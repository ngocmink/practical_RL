An A3C/A2C agent selects actions based on policy, not an epsilon greedy exploration function, for which the argmax can change drastically due to tiny errors in function approximation. Therefore, errors in the value target caused by target chasing will cause less damage.\n",

However, in the formula for the advantage function the two approximations ($Q$-function and $V$-function) come with opposite signs, and thus the errors will cancel out.\n",
